# Super-Smash-Presidents-Brawl

## Summary
This game was made at hackBCAIII by Rohan Khajuria ([@Rohanator9000](https://github.com/Rohanator9000)), Shoji Moto ([@PianoBin](https://github.com/PianoBin)), Jenny Huang ([@huangje1](https://github.com/huangje1)), and Brian Lee([@asi14](https://github.com/asi14)). This game is a spinoff of Super Smash Brothers featuring three of the presidential candidates as characters. We spent most of the time trying to figure out how to make games in Unity, so it features three candidates (Sanders, Clinton, and Trump), basic moves, one stage, and pretty much nothing else. We also made a website [here!](huangje1.github.io).

## Other Mechanics

All characters have ten health. There is no penalty for going off the stage in any direction. There is no restart button. There is no health display.

## Controls

### Everyone

#### Jump

Pretty much a teleport up because we couldn't figure the jump out. Repetitive spamming leads to long waiting for your character to return to the screen.

Sanders: space
Trump: 8
Clinton: up arrow

#### Left-Right Movement

Sliding occurs (kind of like you're on ice).

Sanders: a for left, d for right
Trump: 4 for left, 6 for right
Clinton: left arrow for left, right arrow for right

#### Basic Attack

A proximity attack in front of the character that deals 2 damage.

Sanders: w
Trump: 0
Clinton: down arrow

### Sanders

#### Birdie Sanders

Sanders rides the bird that flew onto his lectern. At the end of the flight, he regains two health. During the flight, he is immune to Clinton's Classified Email move.

#### #feelthebern

Sanders is engulfed in flame. His basic attacks do double the damage. During the flames, he is immune to Clinton's Classified Email move.

### Clinton

#### Classified Email

Hillary turns her opponent into a classified email. During this phase, the opponent can neither basic attack nor use special moves, but can still move.

### Trump

#### Wall

Trump summons a wall in the center of the field. This move is nearly useless. We planned to make it in front of him, but didn't have enough time to figure out how.
